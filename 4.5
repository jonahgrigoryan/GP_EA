im trying to get step by step walkthrough to use @Zencoder agents to build completely the M3 implementation in full @Web i want to use the new sonnet 4.5 to write the steps on how to use zen agents for each step of M3 development. so i need to give it reference what files in the tech spec and design outlie specific to m3 for it to view but also to see the flow of completion of M1 to M2, this is the prompt i have so far but i am stuck, can you tell me how to prompt 4.5 so it can write complete outline for how to best use zen agents at each step but only specific to M3, so help me complete the prompt :

reference the following files for assistance: finalspec.md, .kiro/specs/rpea-m3/requirements.md, .kiro/specs/rpea-m3/design.md, .kiro/specs/rpea-m3/tasks.md
from the spec, the current repo branch has implemented M1 and M2 milestones. development on M3 is ready to start by using zencoder.ai agents end-to-end (M3 only, for now).
